#### Full text search and pivoting

The goal was to learn text search methods offered by PostgreSQL, and table pivoting. This is just a small web app written to demostrate those functionalities.

Technologies:

- Javascript (ReactJS) on frontend
- Python (Flask) on backend
- PostgreSQL database is used to save textual data
- Nginx as a reverse proxy

To run the app:

1. Run the containers using `docker-compose up --build -d`
2. App is running on **http://localhost**
3. pgAdmin4 can be accessed on **http://localhost:5000**
